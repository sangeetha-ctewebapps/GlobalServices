Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in data]

    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'message': f'Missing documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = data['identification']
    proof_of_income = data['proof_of_income']
    credit_history = data['credit_history']
    employment_details = data['employment_details']

    # Perform document verification logic here
    # ...

    # Assess loan eligibility
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({'report': report, 'eligibility_status': eligibility_status})

def assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Perform loan eligibility assessment logic here
    # ...

    return 'eligible'  # or 'not eligible' depending on the assessment

def generate_eligibility_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate eligibility report logic here
    # ...

    return 'Eligibility Report'

def notify_bank_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Notify bank employee logic here
    # ...

    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we have defined a Flask API endpoint `/loan/verification` that accepts a JSON payload containing the required documents for loan verification. The API endpoint checks if all the required documents are provided and then proceeds to verify the documents, assess loan eligibility, generate an eligibility report, and notify the bank employee.

Note: The code provided is a basic implementation and may need further customization and validation based on your specific requirements.
