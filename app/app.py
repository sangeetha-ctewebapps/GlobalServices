Here is an example of a Python Flask API code for the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# List of required documents for loan application
required_documents = ["identification", "proof_of_income", "credit_history", "employment_details"]

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.json
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if all(document in data for document in required_documents):
        # Verify the provided documents
        is_documents_verified = verify_documents(data)
        
        if is_documents_verified:
            # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
            eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(data)
            
            # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
            report = generate_report(data, eligibility_status)
            
            # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
            notify_employee(eligibility_status)
            
            return jsonify(report), 200
        else:
            return jsonify({"message": "Documents verification failed"}), 400
    else:
        return jsonify({"message": "Missing required documents"}), 400

def verify_documents(data):
    # Add verification logic here
    # Example: Check if the provided documents are authentic and accurate
    return True

def assess_eligibility(data):
    # Add eligibility assessment logic here
    # Example: Calculate the applicant's eligibility based on the provided documents
    return "Eligible" if data["proof_of_income"] > 5000 else "Not Eligible"

def generate_report(data, eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = {
        "applicant_name": data["identification"]["name"],
        "eligibility_status": eligibility_status
    }
    return report

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    # Add notification logic here
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
