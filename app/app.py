Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_verification', methods=['POST'])
def loan_verification():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    if not all(doc in data for doc in required_documents):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing required documents'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents

    # Perform identification verification
    identification_verified = verify_identification(data['identification'])

    # Perform proof of income verification
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(data['proof_of_income'])

    # Perform credit history verification
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(data['credit_history'])

    # Perform employment details verification
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(data['employment_details'])

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification logic
    return True  # Replace with your logic

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform proof of income verification logic
    return True  # Replace with your logic

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification logic
    return True  # Replace with your logic

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification logic
    return True  # Replace with your logic

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic based on the verified documents
    return True  # Replace with your logic

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    return 'Eligible' if eligibility_status else 'Not Eligible'

def notify_employee(report):
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    print(f'Eligibility Report: {report}')  # Replace with your notification logic

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan_verification` that accepts a POST request. The JSON payload of the request should include the required documents: identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, and employment_details. The API then verifies each document, assesses the applicant's eligibility, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that the verification, assessment, report generation, and notification logic are placeholders and should be replaced with your actual implementation. Additionally, you may need to customize the code further based on your specific requirements and data structures.

I hope this helps you get started with your Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment! Let me know if you have any further questions.
