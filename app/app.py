Here is a sample code for a Python Flask API that implements the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_checklist():
    checklist = ['Identification', 'Proof of Income', 'Credit History', 'Employment Details']
    return jsonify(checklist)

@app.route('/verify-documents', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # TODO: Implement document verification logic here
    
    eligibility_status = True  # Example value, modify as per your verification logic
    
    return jsonify({'eligibility_status': eligibility_status})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we have defined two API endpoints:

1. `/checklist` - GET request to retrieve the checklist of required documents for the loan application process.
2. `/verify-documents` - POST request to verify the provided documents and assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan.

You can modify the `verify_documents` endpoint to include your own document verification logic. The eligibility status is returned as a JSON response.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and you may need to further enhance and customize it based on your specific requirements.
