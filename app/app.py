Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Route to provide a checklist of required documents for loan application process
@app.route('/documents/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_document_checklist():
    checklist = {
        'identification': 'ID card, Passport',
        'proof_of_income': 'Pay slips, Bank statements',
        'credit_history': 'Credit report, Loan statements',
        'employment_details': 'Employment contract, Offer letter'
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)

# Route to review and verify the provided documents
@app.route('/documents/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    documents = request.json
    
    # Perform verification logic here
    
    # Assuming verification is successful
    verification_status = True
    
    return jsonify({'verification_status': verification_status})

# Route to assess applicant's eligibility for the loan
@app.route('/loan/eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def assess_loan_eligibility():
    applicant_details = request.json
    
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    
    # Assuming eligibility is assessed successfully
    eligibility_status = True
    
    return jsonify({'eligibility_status': eligibility_status})

# Route to generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/loan/report', methods=['POST'])
def generate_loan_report():
    eligibility_status = request.json.get('eligibility_status')
    
    # Generate report logic here
    
    report = {
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
        'report_description': 'The applicant is eligible for the loan.'
    }
    
    return jsonify(report)

# Route to notify bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
@app.route('/loan/notify', methods=['POST'])
def notify_bank_employee():
    eligibility_status = request.json.get('eligibility_status')
    
    # Notify bank employee logic here
    
    if eligibility_status:
        message = 'The applicant is eligible for further processing.'
    else:
        message = 'The applicant is not eligible for the loan.'
    
    return jsonify({'message': message})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

You can test this Flask API code using appropriate HTTP requests to the defined routes. Remember to handle the verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification logic inside the respective route functions.
