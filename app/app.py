Sure! Here's a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'income_proof' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Required documents are missing.'}), 400
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = data['identification']
    income_proof = data['income_proof']
    credit_history = data['credit_history']
    employment_details = data['employment_details']
    
    if not verify_identification(identification):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Identification document is invalid.'}), 400
    
    if not verify_income_proof(income_proof):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Income proof document is invalid.'}), 400
    
    if not verify_credit_history(credit_history):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Credit history document is invalid.'}), 400
    
    if not verify_employment_details(employment_details):
        return jsonify({'error': 'Employment details document is invalid.'}), 400
    
    # Assess the applicant's eligibility
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, income_proof, credit_history, employment_details)
    
    # Generate the eligibility report
    report = generate_report(identification, eligibility_status)
    
    # Notify the bank employee
    notify_employee(report)
    
    return jsonify({'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Add your logic to verify the identification document
    return True

def verify_income_proof(income_proof):
    # Add your logic to verify the income proof document
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Add your logic to verify the credit history document
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Add your logic to verify the employment details document
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification, income_proof, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Add your logic to assess the applicant's eligibility based on the provided documents
    return 'Eligible'  # or 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(identification, eligibility_status):
    # Add your logic to generate the eligibility report
    report = {
        'applicant_name': identification['name'],
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status
    }
    return report

def notify_employee(report):
    # Add your logic to notify the bank employee
    print(f"Notification: Applicant {report['applicant_name']} is {report['eligibility_status']} for the loan.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single route `/loan/verification` that accepts a POST request with JSON data containing the required documents for the loan application process. The code verifies the provided documents and assesses the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents. It then generates a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status and notifies the bank employee.
