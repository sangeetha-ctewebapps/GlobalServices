Here's an example of a Python Flask API code implementation for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data for testing
documents = {
    "identification": False,
    "proof_of_income": False,
    "credit_history": False,
    "employment_details": False
}

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Update the documents status
    if 'identification' in data:
        documents['identification'] = data['identification']
    if 'proof_of_income' in data:
        documents['proof_of_income'] = data['proof_of_income']
    if 'credit_history' in data:
        documents['credit_history'] = data['credit_history']
    if 'employment_details' in data:
        documents['employment_details'] = data['employment_details']

    # Verify the documents
    verification_status = verify_documents()

    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(verification_status)

    # Generate a report
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({
        "verification_status": verification_status,
        "eligibility_status": eligibility_status,
        "report": report
    })

def verify_documents():
    # Perform verification logic here (e.g. check if all documents are provided and valid)
    if all(documents.values()):
        return True
    else:
        return False

def assess_eligibility(verification_status):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here (e.g. check credit history, income, etc.)
    if verification_status:
        # Additional logic for eligibility assessment
        return True
    else:
        return False

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report based on eligibility status and other relevant data
    report = {
        "eligibility_status": eligibility_status,
        "documents": documents
    }
    return report

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status (e.g. send email, update database, etc.)
    if eligibility_status:
        print("Applicant is eligible for the loan.")
    else:
        print("Applicant is not eligible for the loan.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a Flask API with a single POST route `/loan_application`. When a request is made to this route with the required data (identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details), the API updates the status of the documents, verifies them, assesses the eligibility, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee.

Please note that this is a basic implementation and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements.
