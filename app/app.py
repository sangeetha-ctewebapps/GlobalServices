Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Get applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment
    is_identification_valid = verify_identification(identification)
    is_proof_of_income_valid = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income)
    is_credit_history_valid = verify_credit_history(credit_history)
    is_employment_details_valid = verify_employment_details(employment_details)

    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    is_eligible = is_identification_valid and is_proof_of_income_valid and is_credit_history_valid and is_employment_details_valid

    # Generate report
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(is_eligible)

    # Return response
    return jsonify({
        'is_eligible': is_eligible,
        'report': report
    })

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification logic here
    return True  # Placeholder for verification logic

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform proof of income verification logic here
    return True  # Placeholder for verification logic

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification logic here
    return True  # Placeholder for verification logic

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification logic here
    return True  # Placeholder for verification logic

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Generate report based on eligibility status
    if is_eligible:
        return 'Applicant is eligible for the loan.'
    else:
        return 'Applicant is not eligible for the loan.'

def notify_bank_employee(is_eligible):
    # Notify bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    # You can implement email notifications, push notifications, etc. here
    if is_eligible:
        print('Applicant is eligible for further processing.')
    else:
        print('Applicant is not eligible.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan-eligibility` that accepts a POST request with applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. The code then performs document verification and eligibility assessment based on the provided information. It generates a report indicating the eligibility status and notifies the bank employee accordingly.

Note: This is a basic implementation to give you an idea of how the API can be structured. You may need to modify the code according to your specific requirements and integrate it with a database or external services for document verification and notification purposes.
