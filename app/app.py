Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that implements the given User Story for the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    # Get the loan application details from the request
    loan_application_details = request.get_json()

    # Extract the required documents from the loan application details
    identification = loan_application_details.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = loan_application_details.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = loan_application_details.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = loan_application_details.get('employment_details')

    # Verify the provided documents
    identification_verified = verify_document(identification)
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_document(proof_of_income)
    credit_history_verified = verify_document(credit_history)
    employment_details_verified = verify_document(employment_details)

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    # Return the eligibility status as a response
    return jsonify({'eligibility_status': eligibility_status})

def verify_document(document):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    # Return True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return the eligibility status (e.g., 'eligible' or 'not eligible')
    return 'eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    # Return the report as a string
    return f'Eligibility Status: {eligibility_status}'

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    # Perform notification logic here (e.g., send an email or push notification)
    print(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single route `/loan_application` that accepts a POST request containing the loan application details as JSON. It then verifies the provided documents, assesses the applicant's eligibility for the loan, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status. Finally, it returns the eligibility status as a response.

Please note that this code only provides a basic implementation of the given User Story and may need further modifications to meet specific requirements or integrate with existing systems.
