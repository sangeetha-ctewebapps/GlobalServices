Here's an example Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data for document verification
required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if all(doc in data for doc in required_documents):
        # Verify the authenticity and accuracy of the provided documents
        verification_status = verify_documents(data)

        # Assess applicant's eligibility based on verified documents
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(verification_status)

        # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
        report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

        # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
        notify_employee(report)

        return jsonify({'message': 'Document verification process completed successfully.'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Missing required documents.'}), 400

def verify_documents(data):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    # Return a dictionary indicating the verification status of each document
    return {
        'identification': 'verified',
        'proof_of_income': 'verified',
        'credit_history': 'verified',
        'employment_details': 'verified'
    }

def assess_eligibility(verification_status):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return the eligibility status of the applicant
    return 'eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    # Return the report as a dictionary or string
    return 'Eligibility Status: {}'.format(eligibility_status)

def notify_employee(report):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    # Implement the notification logic here, e.g., sending an email or message
    print(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan-application`. When a POST request is made to this endpoint, the `verify_documents` function is called to verify the provided documents. The `assess_eligibility` function then assesses the eligibility based on the verification status, and the `generate_report` function generates a report indicating the eligibility status. Finally, the `notify_employee` function is called to notify the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that this is just a basic example and you may need to customize the logic according to your specific requirements.
