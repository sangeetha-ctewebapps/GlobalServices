Here is an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# API endpoint for the checklist of required documents
@app.route('/documents/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_document_checklist():
    checklist = {
        'identification': 'valid identification document',
        'proof_of_income': 'proof of income document',
        'credit_history': 'credit history document',
        'employment_details': 'employment details document'
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)

# API endpoint for reviewing and verifying documents
@app.route('/documents/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    applicant_documents = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification logic here
    # ...

    # Assess loan eligibility based on verified documents
    is_eligible = True  # Example: assuming all documents are valid

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = {
        'is_eligible': is_eligible,
        'message': 'Applicant is eligible for the loan.' if is_eligible else 'Applicant is not eligible for the loan.'
    }

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    # ...

    return jsonify(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this code, we have defined two API endpoints. The `/documents/checklist` endpoint returns a checklist of required documents for the loan application process as a JSON response.

The `/documents/verification` endpoint accepts a POST request with the applicant's documents in the request body. It performs the document verification logic, assesses the loan eligibility based on the verified documents, generates an eligibility report, and returns it as a JSON response.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you would need to implement the actual document verification logic and notification mechanism based on your specific requirements and systems.
