Sure! Here's a basic Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the loan application details from the request body
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Verify the identification document
    identification_verified = verify_identification(loan_application['identification'])

    # Verify the proof of income document
    income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(loan_application['proof_of_income'])

    # Verify the credit history document
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(loan_application['credit_history'])

    # Verify the employment details document
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(loan_application['employment_details'])

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def verify_identification(identification_document):
    # Add your code to verify the identification document here
    # Return True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_proof_of_income(income_document):
    # Add your code to verify the proof of income document here
    # Return True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_credit_history(credit_history_document):
    # Add your code to verify the credit history document here
    # Return True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def verify_employment_details(employment_details_document):
    # Add your code to verify the employment details document here
    # Return True if the document is verified, False otherwise
    pass

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Add your code to assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents here
    # Return True if the applicant is eligible, False otherwise
    pass

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Add your code to generate the report indicating the applicant's eligibility status here
    # Return the report as a dictionary
    pass

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Add your code to notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status here
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
