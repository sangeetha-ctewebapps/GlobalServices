Sure! Here's a Python Flask API code that handles the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Temporary storage for document verification
documents = {
    "identification": {},
    "proof_of_income": {},
    "credit_history": {},
    "employment_details": {}
}

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    data = request.json
    applicant_id = data.get('applicant_id')

    # Verify identification document
    identification = data.get('identification')
    if identification:
        documents['identification'][applicant_id] = identification

    # Verify proof of income document
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    if proof_of_income:
        documents['proof_of_income'][applicant_id] = proof_of_income

    # Verify credit history document
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    if credit_history:
        documents['credit_history'][applicant_id] = credit_history

    # Verify employment details document
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')
    if employment_details:
        documents['employment_details'][applicant_id] = employment_details

    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(applicant_id)

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(applicant_id, eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(applicant_id, eligibility_status)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def assess_eligibility(applicant_id):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # You can access the verified documents using 'documents' dictionary

    # For demonstration purposes, assume all applicants are eligible
    return 'Eligible'

def generate_report(applicant_id, eligibility_status):
    # Generate eligibility report logic here
    report = {
        'applicant_id': applicant_id,
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status
    }
    return report

def notify_bank_employee(applicant_id, eligibility_status):
    # Notify bank employee logic here
    # You can send a notification to the employee or update a database record, etc.
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single POST endpoint `/loan/application` that handles the verification of documents for loan eligibility assessment. It receives a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. It then verifies each document and performs an eligibility assessment based on the verified documents.

Please note that this code is a basic implementation and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements and integrate it with your existing systems.
