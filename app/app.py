Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given User Story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Validate required documents
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in loan_application]

    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify document authenticity and accuracy
    is_documents_verified = verify_documents(loan_application)

    if not is_documents_verified:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Documents verification failed'}), 400

    # Assess loan eligibility
    is_eligible = assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application)

    # Generate eligibility report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee
    notify_bank_employee(is_eligible)

    return jsonify({'eligibility_report': eligibility_report})

def verify_documents(loan_application):
    # Perform document verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are verified, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application):
    # Perform loan eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return True if applicant is eligible, False otherwise
    return True

def generate_eligibility_report(is_eligible):
    # Generate eligibility report logic here
    eligibility_status = 'Eligible' if is_eligible else 'Not Eligible'
    return {'status': eligibility_status}

def notify_bank_employee(is_eligible):
    # Notify bank employee logic here
    if is_eligible:
        print('Applicant is eligible for further processing')
    else:
        print('Applicant is not eligible')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()

```

This code defines a Flask API with a single route `/loan/application` that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload representing the loan application. The code then performs the document verification process, loan eligibility assessment, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee accordingly. The response is returned as a JSON object containing the eligibility report.
