Here is an example code for a Flask API that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']

    # Verify if all required documents are provided
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in loan_application]
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify and assess loan eligibility based on provided documents
    is_eligible = verify_documents(loan_application)

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report)

def verify_documents(loan_application):
    # Add your logic here to verify the authenticity and accuracy of the provided documents
    # Return True or False based on the verification process
    pass

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Add your logic here to generate the eligibility report
    # Return a dictionary with the report details
    pass

def notify_employee(report):
    # Add your logic here to notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that the code provided is just a basic template and does not include the actual implementation of the document verification process. You will need to fill in the logic for verifying the documents, generating the eligibility report, and notifying the bank employee based on your specific requirements.
