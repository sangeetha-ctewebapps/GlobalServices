Sure! Here's a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'proof_of_income' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Please provide all required documents'}), 400
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = data['identification']
    proof_of_income = data['proof_of_income']
    credit_history = data['credit_history']
    employment_details = data['employment_details']
    
    # Perform document verification process (dummy logic)
    if verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
        # Assess loan eligibility (dummy logic)
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
        
        # Generate eligibility report
        report = generate_report(eligibility_status)
        
        # Notify the bank employee
        notify_employee(eligibility_status)
        
        return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application processed successfully', 'eligibility_status': eligibility_status, 'report': report}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Document verification failed. Please provide valid documents'}), 400

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement document verification logic
    # Return True if all documents are verified successfully, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement loan eligibility assessment logic
    # Return eligibility status (e.g., True for eligible, False for not eligible)
    return True

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Implement report generation logic
    # Return eligibility report
    return 'Eligibility Report: {}'.format(eligibility_status)

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Implement notification logic to notify the bank employee
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API endpoint `/loan_application` that accepts a POST request with a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. It then verifies the provided documents, assesses the loan eligibility based on the verified documents, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee.

Please note that the `verify_documents`, `assess_eligibility`, `generate_report`, and `notify_employee` functions contain dummy logic placeholders and should be implemented according to your specific requirements.
