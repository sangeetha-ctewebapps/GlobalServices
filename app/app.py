Sure! Here's a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint for submitting loan application
@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def submit_loan_application():
    # Get applicant's details from request
    applicant_details = request.json
    
    # Verify identification document
    identification_doc = applicant_details.get('identification_doc')
    identification_verified = verify_identification(identification_doc)
    
    # Verify proof of income document
    proof_of_income_doc = applicant_details.get('proof_of_income_doc')
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc)
    
    # Verify credit history document
    credit_history_doc = applicant_details.get('credit_history_doc')
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(credit_history_doc)
    
    # Verify employment details document
    employment_details_doc = applicant_details.get('employment_details_doc')
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(employment_details_doc)
    
    # Assess applicant's eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)
    
    # Generate report
    report = generate_report(applicant_details, eligibility_status)
    
    # Notify bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)
    
    # Return response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application submitted successfully.'}), 200

def verify_identification(identification_doc):
    # TODO: Implementation for verifying identification document
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income_doc):
    # TODO: Implementation for verifying proof of income document
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history_doc):
    # TODO: Implementation for verifying credit history document
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details_doc):
    # TODO: Implementation for verifying employment details document
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # TODO: Implementation for assessing eligibility based on verified documents
    return 'Eligible' if identification_verified and proof_of_income_verified and credit_history_verified and employment_details_verified else 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(applicant_details, eligibility_status):
    # TODO: Implementation for generating report
    report = {
        'name': applicant_details.get('name'),
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status
    }
    return report

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # TODO: Implementation for notifying bank employee
    print(f"Notification sent to bank employee: {report}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is just a basic implementation and you will need to replace the TODO comments with your own logic for verifying documents, assessing eligibility, generating a report, and notifying the bank employee. Also, make sure to install Flask (`pip install Flask`) before running the code.
