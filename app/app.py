Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data for demonstration purposes
required_documents = ["Identification", "Proof of Income", "Credit History", "Employment Details"]

@app.route('/loan_application', methods=['POST'])
def process_loan_application():
    # Get the loan application data from the request body
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Verify the provided documents
    documents_verified = verify_documents(loan_application)

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(documents_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report)

def verify_documents(loan_application):
    verified_documents = []

    for document in required_documents:
        if document in loan_application['documents']:
            verified_documents.append(document + ': Verified')
        else:
            verified_documents.append(document + ': Not Provided')

    return verified_documents

def assess_eligibility(documents_verified):
    # Perform eligibility assessment based on verified documents
    # This is just a dummy implementation for demonstration purposes
    if len(documents_verified) == len(required_documents):
        return "Eligible"
    else:
        return "Not Eligible"

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    report = {
        'eligibility_status': eligibility_status,
        'required_documents': required_documents
    }

    return report

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Send notification to the bank employee
    # This is just a dummy implementation for demonstration purposes
    print("Notification sent to bank employee: ", report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API with a single route ("/loan_application") that accepts a POST request for processing loan applications. The `process_loan_application` function handles the loan application data, verifies the provided documents, assesses the eligibility based on the documents, generates a report, and notifies the bank employee. The response is returned as a JSON object.

Please note that this is a simplified example and should be further enhanced and customized to meet your specific requirements.
