Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's details from request
    applicant_details = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification process
    identification_verified = verify_identification(applicant_details.get('identification'))
    income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(applicant_details.get('proof_of_income'))
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(applicant_details.get('credit_history'))
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(applicant_details.get('employment_details'))

    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate report indicating eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_employee(eligibility_status)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def verify_identification(identification):
    # Implement identification verification logic
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Implement proof of income verification logic
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Implement credit history verification logic
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Implement employment details verification logic
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Implement eligibility assessment logic based on verified documents
    if identification_verified and income_verified and credit_history_verified and employment_details_verified:
        return "Eligible"
    else:
        return "Not Eligible"

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate report indicating eligibility status
    return {'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

def notify_employee(eligibility_status):
    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status for further processing
    if eligibility_status == "Eligible":
        message = "Applicant is eligible for the loan."
    else:
        message = "Applicant is not eligible for the loan."
    
    print(message)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

You can run this code to start a Flask server that listens for POST requests at the `/loan/verification` endpoint. The server will perform the document verification process, assess the applicant's eligibility, generate a report, and notify the bank employee accordingly.
