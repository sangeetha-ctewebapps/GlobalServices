Here's a basic Python Flask API code that can be used for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Verify identification document
    if 'identification' not in loan_application:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Identification document is missing'}), 400

    # Verify proof of income document
    if 'proof_of_income' not in loan_application:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Proof of income document is missing'}), 400

    # Verify credit history document
    if 'credit_history' not in loan_application:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Credit history document is missing'}), 400

    # Verify employment details document
    if 'employment_details' not in loan_application:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Employment details document is missing'}), 400

    # Perform document verification logic here
    # ...

    # Assess loan eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application)

    # Generate eligibility report
    eligibility_report = generate_eligibility_report(loan_application, eligibility_status)

    # Notify bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(loan_application['applicant_id'], eligibility_status)

    return jsonify(eligibility_report), 200

def assess_loan_eligibility(loan_application):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # ...

    return eligibility_status

def generate_eligibility_report(loan_application, eligibility_status):
    # Generate eligibility report logic here
    # ...

    return eligibility_report

def notify_bank_employee(applicant_id, eligibility_status):
    # Notify bank employee logic here
    # ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

This code defines a Flask API that listens for POST requests on the '/loan/verification' endpoint. It expects a JSON payload containing the loan application details, including the required documents. It then verifies the presence of each required document, performs document verification logic, assesses the loan eligibility based on the verified documents, generates an eligibility report, and notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Please note that this code only provides a basic structure and you will need to implement the actual document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification logic according to your specific requirements.
