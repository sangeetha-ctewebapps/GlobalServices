Here is a sample Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint to receive loan application documents
@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def loan_application():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment
    identification = data.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = data.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = data.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = data.get('employment_details')

    # Verify documents and assess eligibility
    if verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
        generate_report(identification, eligibility_status)
        notify_employee(identification, eligibility_status)
        return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application processed successfully.'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Invalid or missing documents.'}), 400

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement document verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are valid, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return the eligibility status based on the documents
    return 'Eligible' if True else 'Not Eligible'

def generate_report(identification, eligibility_status):
    # Implement report generation logic here
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    pass

def notify_employee(identification, eligibility_status):
    # Implement notification logic here
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code sets up a Flask API with a single endpoint `/loan-application` to receive loan application documents. The `verify_documents` function checks the provided documents for authenticity and accuracy. The `assess_eligibility` function evaluates the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents. The `generate_report` function generates a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status, and the `notify_employee` function sends a notification to the bank employee regarding the applicant's eligibility status.

Please note that the document verification, eligibility assessment, report generation, and notification logic are placeholders and need to be implemented according to your specific requirements.
