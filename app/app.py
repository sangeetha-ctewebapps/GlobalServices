Sure! Here's a basic example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a route for document verification
@app.route('/verify_documents', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Perform document verification process
    identification_verified = verify_identification(loan_application['identification'])
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(loan_application['proof_of_income'])
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(loan_application['credit_history'])
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(loan_application['employment_details'])

    # Assess loan eligibility based on the verified documents
    loan_eligibility = assess_loan_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_eligibility_report(loan_eligibility)

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

# Helper functions for document verification and loan assessment
def verify_identification(identification):
    # Perform identification verification process
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Perform proof of income verification process
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Perform credit history verification process
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Perform employment details verification process
    return True

def assess_loan_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Perform loan eligibility assessment based on the verified documents
    return True

def generate_eligibility_report(loan_eligibility):
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    return "Eligible" if loan_eligibility else "Not Eligible"

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    print("Loan eligibility report: ", report)

# Run the application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, we define a Flask API with a single route `/verify_documents` that accepts a POST request containing the loan application data. The loan application data is expected to be in JSON format.

Inside the `verify_documents` route, we perform the document verification process by calling helper functions such as `verify_identification`, `verify_proof_of_income`, `verify_credit_history`, and `verify_employment_details`. These functions can be replaced with actual logic to verify the provided documents.

Next, we assess the loan eligibility based on the verified documents by calling the `assess_loan_eligibility` function. Again, this function can be replaced with actual logic to determine the loan eligibility.

After assessing the loan eligibility, we generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status using the `generate_eligibility_report` function. Finally, we notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status by calling the `notify_bank_employee` function.

Please note that this is a basic example and you may need to modify it according to your specific requirements and business logic.
