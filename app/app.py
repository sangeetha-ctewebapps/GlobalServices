Sure! Here's an example Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details
    identification = request.json.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = request.json.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = request.json.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.json.get('employment_details')
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    if verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
        # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
        eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
        
        # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
        report = generate_report(eligibility_status)
        
        # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
        notify_employee(report)
        
        return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'message': 'Loan verification completed.'}), 200
    else:
        return jsonify({'status': 'error', 'message': 'Verification failed. Please provide all required documents.'}), 400

def verify_documents(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement document verification logic here
    # Return True if all documents are valid, False otherwise
    return True

def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Implement eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return 'eligible' or 'not eligible' based on the documents
    return 'eligible'

def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    # Return the report as a string or JSON object
    return {'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

def notify_employee(report):
    # Implement notification logic here
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    print(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single POST endpoint `/loan/verification` for verifying loan eligibility. The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. 

The `verify_loan_eligibility` function handles the loan verification process. It first verifies the provided documents using the `verify_documents` function. If the documents are valid, it then assesses the applicant's eligibility using the `assess_eligibility` function. Finally, it generates a report using the `generate_report` function and notifies the bank employee using the `notify_employee` function.

You can customize the implementation of the document verification and eligibility assessment logic according to your requirements.
