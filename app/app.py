Sure! Here's an example Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_application():
    loan_application = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in loan_application]
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': f'Missing documents: {", ".join(missing_documents)}'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents
    is_documents_verified = verify_documents(loan_application)
    
    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    is_eligible = assess_eligibility(loan_application)

    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(is_eligible)

    return jsonify({'is_eligible': is_eligible, 'report': report}), 200

def verify_documents(loan_application):
    # Implementation to verify the authenticity and accuracy of documents
    return True

def assess_eligibility(loan_application):
    # Implementation to assess eligibility based on verified documents
    return True

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    # Implementation to generate the eligibility report
    return 'Eligible' if is_eligible else 'Not Eligible'

def notify_bank_employee(is_eligible):
    # Implementation to notify the bank employee of eligibility status
    if is_eligible:
        print('Loan application is eligible.')
    else:
        print('Loan application is not eligible.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

You can run this Flask API code to create an HTTP endpoint `/loan/application` that accepts POST requests for loan applications. The API will validate the provided documents, verify their authenticity and accuracy, assess the applicant's eligibility, generate a report, and notify the bank employee of the eligibility status.

Note: This is just a basic implementation to demonstrate the flow. You may need to modify and enhance the code to suit your specific requirements.
