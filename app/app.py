Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define a list of required documents
required_documents = ["identification", "proof of income", "credit history", "employment details"]

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get the applicant's documents from the request
    applicant_documents = request.json

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    missing_documents = [doc for doc in required_documents if doc not in applicant_documents]
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify(error=f"Missing documents: {', '.join(missing_documents)}"), 400

    # Perform document verification (dummy implementation)
    is_documents_verified = True  # Replace with your actual document verification logic

    if not is_documents_verified:
        return jsonify(error="Document verification failed"), 400

    # Perform loan eligibility assessment (dummy implementation)
    is_eligible = True  # Replace with your actual loan eligibility assessment logic

    # Generate the eligibility report
    report = {
        "applicant_name": applicant_documents.get("identification").get("name"),
        "eligibility_status": "Eligible" if is_eligible else "Not Eligible"
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify(report), 200

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Replace with your actual notification logic, such as sending an email or message
    print(f"Applicant: {report['applicant_name']}, Eligibility Status: {report['eligibility_status']}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan/verify` that accepts a POST request with the applicant's documents in the JSON format. We first check if all the required documents are provided and return an error response if any document is missing. Then, we perform document verification and loan eligibility assessment (dummy implementations) based on your actual logic. Finally, we generate a report indicating the eligibility status and notify the bank employee. You can replace the dummy logic with your actual document verification and loan eligibility assessment logic.
