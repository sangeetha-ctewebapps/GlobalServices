Sure! Here's a basic Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan-eligibility', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    # Get the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details from the request
    identification = request.form.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = request.form.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = request.form.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.form.get('employment_details')
    
    # Verify the documents (you can add your own verification logic here)
    documents_verified = True
    
    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents
    eligible_for_loan = documents_verified
    
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status for the loan
    report = {
        'identification': identification,
        'proof_of_income': proof_of_income,
        'credit_history': credit_history,
        'employment_details': employment_details,
        'eligible_for_loan': eligible_for_loan
    }
    
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status for further processing
    # You can replace this with your own notification logic (e.g., sending an email)
    notification = f"Applicant {identification} is {'eligible' if eligible_for_loan else 'not eligible'} for the loan."
    
    return jsonify(report=report, notification=notification)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API endpoint `/loan-eligibility` that accepts a POST request. The applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details are extracted from the request. The documents are then verified (you can add your own verification logic). Based on the verification result, the applicant's eligibility for the loan is assessed. Finally, a report containing the applicant's details and eligibility status is generated, and a notification is sent to the bank employee.

Note: This code is a basic implementation and may require further modifications and improvements based on your specific requirements and business logic.
