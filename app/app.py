Sure! Here's an example of Python Flask API code that implements the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# API route for document verification process
@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    # Get applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details from the request
    identification = request.form.get('identification')
    proof_of_income = request.form.get('proof_of_income')
    credit_history = request.form.get('credit_history')
    employment_details = request.form.get('employment_details')

    # Perform document verification and eligibility assessment logic
    # Replace this with your own verification and assessment algorithm
    is_identification_verified = verify_identification(identification)
    is_proof_of_income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income)
    is_credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(credit_history)
    is_employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(employment_details)

    # Assess eligibility based on the verified documents
    is_eligible = is_identification_verified and is_proof_of_income_verified and is_credit_history_verified and is_employment_details_verified

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(is_eligible)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    # Return the eligibility status as a response
    return jsonify({'is_eligible': is_eligible, 'report': report})

# Helper functions for document verification and assessment
def verify_identification(identification):
    # Your logic for verification goes here
    return True  # Replace with your own logic

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Your logic for verification goes here
    return True  # Replace with your own logic

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Your logic for verification goes here
    return True  # Replace with your own logic

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Your logic for verification goes here
    return True  # Replace with your own logic

def generate_report(is_eligible):
    if is_eligible:
        return 'Eligible for the loan'
    else:
        return 'Not eligible for the loan'

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # Your notification logic goes here
    print(report)  # Replace with your own logic

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single route `/loan/verify` that accepts a POST request containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. The code then performs the document verification and eligibility assessment logic based on the acceptance criteria and generates a report indicating the eligibility status. Finally, it notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status and returns the eligibility status and report as a JSON response.

Please note that the verification and assessment logic in the example code is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with your own logic based on the specific requirements and rules of your bank's document verification process.
