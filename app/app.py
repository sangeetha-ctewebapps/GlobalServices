Sure, here's an example of Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verification', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()

    # Check if all required documents are provided
    if 'identification' not in data or 'proof_of_income' not in data or 'credit_history' not in data or 'employment_details' not in data:
        return jsonify({'message': 'Please provide all required documents'}), 400

    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = data['identification']
    proof_of_income = data['proof_of_income']
    credit_history = data['credit_history']
    employment_details = data['employment_details']

    if not verify_identification(identification):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Identification document is not valid'}), 400

    if not verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Proof of income document is not valid'}), 400

    if not verify_credit_history(credit_history):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Credit history document is not valid'}), 400

    if not verify_employment_details(employment_details):
        return jsonify({'message': 'Employment details document is not valid'}), 400

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan
    eligibility_status = assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)

    # Generate a report indicating the eligibility status
    report = generate_report(identification, eligibility_status)

    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    notify_bank_employee(report)

    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan verification process completed successfully'})

def verify_identification(identification):
    # TODO: Implement identification verification logic
    return True

def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # TODO: Implement proof of income verification logic
    return True

def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # TODO: Implement credit history verification logic
    return True

def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement employment details verification logic
    return True

def assess_loan_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # TODO: Implement loan eligibility assessment logic
    return True

def generate_report(identification, eligibility_status):
    # TODO: Implement report generation logic
    return {'identification': identification, 'eligibility_status': eligibility_status}

def notify_bank_employee(report):
    # TODO: Implement notification logic for bank employee
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define a Flask API with a single route `/loan/verification` that handles the loan verification process. The API expects a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details.

The API first checks if all required documents are provided. If any of the documents are missing, it returns an error message with status code 400.

Next, the API verifies each document using separate verification functions. You can implement the verification logic for each document based on your specific requirements.

After verifying all documents, the API assesses the applicant's eligibility for the loan using the `assess_loan_eligibility` function. Again, you can implement the assessment logic based on your specific criteria.

The API then generates a report indicating the eligibility status using the `generate_report` function. Finally, it notifies the bank employee of the eligibility status using the `notify_bank_employee` function. You can implement the notification logic based on your preferred method of communication.

Please note that the verification, assessment, report generation, and notification logic are left as placeholders (`TODO`) in the code. You will need to implement these functions according to your specific requirements.
