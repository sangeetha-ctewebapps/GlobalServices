Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code that can handle the Bank's Document Verification Process for Loan Eligibility Assessment:

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data for document verification
documents = {
    "identification": {
        "required": True,
        "verified": False
    },
    "proof_of_income": {
        "required": True,
        "verified": False
    },
    "credit_history": {
        "required": True,
        "verified": False
    },
    "employment_details": {
        "required": True,
        "verified": False
    }
}

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['GET'])
def get_document_checklist():
    return jsonify(documents)

@app.route('/loan-application', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    # Verify the provided documents by updating the verification status
    for document in documents:
        documents[document]['verified'] = request.json.get(document, False)

    # Assess the applicant's eligibility based on the verified documents
    eligibility = all(document['verified'] for document in documents.values())

    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = {
        "eligibility": eligibility,
        "documents": documents
    }

    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    # (you can implement the notification mechanism here)

    return jsonify(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this code, we define two routes: `/loan-application` for getting the document checklist and verifying the documents. 

The `GET` request to `/loan-application` returns the current checklist of required documents in the JSON format.

The `POST` request to `/loan-application` expects the verification status of each document in the request body. It updates the verification status of each document accordingly, assesses the eligibility based on the verified documents, generates a report with the eligibility status and the verified documents, and returns the report in the JSON format.

You can run this code on your local machine by installing the necessary Flask dependencies and executing the script.
