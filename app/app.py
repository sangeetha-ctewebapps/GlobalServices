Here is an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint for providing a checklist of required documents
@app.route('/loan/documents/checklist', methods=['GET'])
def get_document_checklist():
    checklist = {
        'identification': 'ID card or passport',
        'proof_of_income': 'Pay slips or bank statements',
        'credit_history': 'Credit report or score',
        'employment_details': 'Employment contract or offer letter'
    }
    return jsonify(checklist)

# Endpoint for reviewing and verifying the provided documents
@app.route('/loan/documents/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_documents():
    documents = request.get_json()
    
    # Perform verification process for each document
    identification_verified = verify_identification(documents.get('identification'))
    proof_of_income_verified = verify_proof_of_income(documents.get('proof_of_income'))
    credit_history_verified = verify_credit_history(documents.get('credit_history'))
    employment_details_verified = verify_employment_details(documents.get('employment_details'))
    
    # Assess eligibility based on verified documents
    eligibility = assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified)
    
    # Generate eligibility report
    report = generate_report(eligibility)
    
    # Notify bank employee of eligibility status
    notify_employee(eligibility)
    
    return jsonify(report)

# Helper function for verifying identification document
def verify_identification(identification):
    # Logic for verifying identification document
    return True

# Helper function for verifying proof of income document
def verify_proof_of_income(proof_of_income):
    # Logic for verifying proof of income document
    return True

# Helper function for verifying credit history document
def verify_credit_history(credit_history):
    # Logic for verifying credit history document
    return True

# Helper function for verifying employment details document
def verify_employment_details(employment_details):
    # Logic for verifying employment details document
    return True

# Helper function for assessing eligibility based on verified documents
def assess_eligibility(identification_verified, proof_of_income_verified, credit_history_verified, employment_details_verified):
    # Logic for assessing eligibility based on verified documents
    return True

# Helper function for generating eligibility report
def generate_report(eligibility):
    # Logic for generating eligibility report
    return {'status': 'Eligible' if eligibility else 'Not Eligible'}

# Helper function for notifying bank employee of eligibility status
def notify_employee(eligibility):
    # Logic for notifying bank employee of eligibility status
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Please note that this is just a basic implementation of the Flask API for the given user story. You may need to modify and add more logic according to your specific requirements.
