Sure! Here's an example of a Python Flask API code for the given user story:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/loan/verify', methods=['POST'])
def verify_loan_eligibility():
    data = request.get_json()
    
    # Check if all required documents are provided
    required_documents = ['identification', 'proof_of_income', 'credit_history', 'employment_details']
    missing_documents = []
    for doc in required_documents:
        if doc not in data:
            missing_documents.append(doc)
    
    if missing_documents:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Missing documents', 'missing_documents': missing_documents}), 400
    
    # Verify the provided documents
    identification = data['identification']
    proof_of_income = data['proof_of_income']
    credit_history = data['credit_history']
    employment_details = data['employment_details']
    
    # Perform document verification logic here
    
    # Assess the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on verified documents
    eligibility_status = assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details)
    
    # Generate a report indicating the applicant's eligibility status
    report = generate_report(eligibility_status)
    
    # Notify the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status
    notify_employee(report)
    
    return jsonify({'report': report}), 200

def assess_eligibility(identification, proof_of_income, credit_history, employment_details):
    # Perform eligibility assessment logic here
    # Return eligibility status
    
def generate_report(eligibility_status):
    # Generate a report based on eligibility status
    # Return the report
    
def notify_employee(report):
    # Notify the bank employee of the eligibility status
    # Implement the notification logic here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines a Flask API with a single POST endpoint `/loan/verify`. The endpoint expects a JSON payload containing the applicant's identification, proof of income, credit history, and employment details. It checks if all the required documents are provided and returns an error response if any documents are missing.

Next, the code performs document verification logic (which you need to implement) and assesses the applicant's eligibility for the loan based on the verified documents. It generates a report indicating the eligibility status and notifies the bank employee of the applicant's eligibility status (you need to implement the notification logic as well).

Please note that you will need to implement the `assess_eligibility`, `generate_report`, and `notify_employee` functions according to your specific requirements.

Don't forget to install Flask (`pip install flask`) before running the code.
